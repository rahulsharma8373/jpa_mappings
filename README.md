ORM Mappings in Spring Boot
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique used to convert data between incompatible systems (object-oriented programming languages and relational databases). In Spring Boot, ORM is typically implemented using JPA (Java Persistence API) with Hibernate as the default JPA provider.

Key Concepts in ORM:
Entity: Represents a table in the database.
Primary Key: A unique identifier for each entity instance.
Relationships: Define associations between different entities.
